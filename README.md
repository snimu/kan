# kan
Ablate KAN and Fourier KAN vs. normal Linear Layers in LLMs.

Based on my package [hlb-gpt-cli](https://github.com/snimu/hlb-gpt-cli),
which in turn is based on
[Fern](https://github.com/tysam-code)'s [hlb-gpt](https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-gpt).

Currently uses FourierKANs from [FourierKAN](https://github.com/GistNoesis/FourierKAN/tree/main),
because the code is simpler to understand and therefore use than the original implementation of
[pykan](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan/tree/master).
I do plan on testing KAN with splines at some point, though.

Results are coming soon.
